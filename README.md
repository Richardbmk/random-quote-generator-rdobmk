# Testing Python project workflow

We set up a simple CI/CD pipeline for a Python package published to PyPI. Code on each branch is checked with tests and code quality. You can check code coverage inside CodeCov. On releases, new versions are deployed to PyPI and the docs are updated. This can simplify your life a lot.
